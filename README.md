# AI - NTUA

The first programming assignment for Artifial Intelligence NTUA 2018-2019.

This application is an implementation of A* algorithm in Java used for\
finding best taxi routes from their starting point to a single point. \
There is also a report explaining the use of and showing some testcases.

## Make and Run 

In order to run the program we compile by running: 

$ make

and the we run the program with :

$ java AIask1

The program reads the client's location from client.csv , the available taxis' locations from taxis.csv , the available roads from nodes1.csv and returns the id of the taxi closer to the client's location as well its distance from the client.
